# GitHub Repository Analyzer

This is a web application that uses the GitHub API and ChatGPT to analyze GitHub user repositories and determine the most complex one based on the number of files and lines of code. The application is built using Flask and Python.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- GitHub personal access token
- Flask installed (you can install it using `pip install Flask`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/github-repo-analyzer.git
cd github-repo-analyzer
```

2. Create a file named `config.json` in the root directory with the following content, replacing `YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual GitHub personal access token:

```json
{
  "GITHUB": "YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN"
}
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests pyphen openai
```

4. Run the Flask web application:

```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the GitHub Repository Analyzer.

## How It Works

The application prompts you to enter a GitHub user repository URL. Upon submitting the URL, the application fetches the user's repositories using the GitHub API and displays a list of repositories. For each repository, it calculates the complexity score based on the number of files and lines of code in each file. The repository with the highest complexity score is identified as the most complex one and is displayed on the web page.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Flask
- GitHub API
- ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)
- HTML/CSS (for the web interface)

## Disclaimer

This application uses ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. While it tries to provide accurate results, it may not always be perfect. Use the results with caution and verify them manually if needed.

Please make sure to replace `your_username` in the repository URL with your actual GitHub username, and also replace `YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your GitHub personal access token in the `config.json` file.
